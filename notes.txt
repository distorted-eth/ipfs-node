Current status:
- IPFS node works great! Confirmed that peers are populating, and it appears content is available, although I haven't found a 100% certain way to access content from a specific node.
- The current init strategy isn't optimal, because there is a "config" file created that populates with a pvt key and networking; this will need to be initialized on every container startup.
- It would be best to run a "pin add" on a live EC2 instance, then copy those resulting files into the container via Dockerfile, so that transfer costs and the long wait to download all the pin files can be avoided. 
  - Can I add the resulting docker image to Docker Hub? That might be the easiest approach. Otherwise we'd have to host IPFS files in GH to be copied over which is also not optimal.
